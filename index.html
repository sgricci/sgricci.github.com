  <p>Dewdrop (v0.9), the <a href="https://droplr.com/join/uOXTW96Q">Droplr</a> client for Linux,
is now available for download. It can be downloaded here:
<a href="http://d.pr/f/k2fG">d.pr/f/k2fG</a></p>

<p>This release brings us very close to my vision of a feature complete version 1.0
release.</p>

<p>In this version, a new Note Window has been added (much like the official Droplr
(Mac) client), which will allow you to paste in text to upload to droplr, with
selections for type (Markdown, etc).</p>

<p>Also in this version, a new drop target. This allows you to upload files via
drag and drop.</p>

<p>The vast majority of these changes are only here because Dewdrop is also
now open source:

(<a href="http://gricci.com/2013/06/27/now-open-source-dewdrop/">more info</a>)</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/adamgalloway-nrg">adamgalloway-nrg</a> for putting in
some great new features and making this release possible.</p>

<p>And please report any bugs and/or feature requests on
<a href="https://github.com/sgricci/dewdrop/issues">the official github repo</a>.</p>

  <p>I recently open sourced the Linux <a href="https://droplr.com/join/VWrQ8aUQ">Droplr (referral link)</a>.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s Python and GTK. I&#8217;ve licensed it under GPLv2.</p>

<p>Since the Droplr API is restricted, you&#8217;ll have to get your own API keys from the guys
over at Droplr. You can find more information
<a href="http://help.droplr.com/customer/portal/articles/1014091-introduction">here</a>.
Droplr has assured me that they would try hook up anyone requesting API credentials ASAP.</p>

<p>You can find the code on <a href="http://github.com/sgricci/dewdrop">github</a>.</p>

  <p>My keyboard is quite important to me. I spend a lot of time using it.  I even
use Vim with arrow keys disabled (using hjkl instead).</p>

<p>I bought a <a href="http://www.daskeyboard.com">dasKeyboard</a> at the end of February and
have had nothing but issues with it ever since I received it. The following is a
timeline of my experience so far with dasKeyboard, to be used as a warning
for anyone considering purchasing one of these keyboards.</p>

<p>On February 26th, 2013, I purchased a <a href="http://www.daskeyboard.com">dasKeyboard</a> from
Amazon. (I purchased through Amazon rather than dasKeyboard because I have Prime)</p>

<p>The keyboard arrived the following Thursday (February 28th, 2013).</p>

<p>On March 7th 2013, the following keys stopped working completely: 8ik,.  I immediately
went to Amazon and reported the issue, and requested that a replacement be sent out.
Amazon sent one out immediately and gave me all necessary paperwork to send the old
one back to them free of charge. Shit happens.</p>

<p>On March 11th, 2013, the replacement dasKeyboard arrived. And there was much
rejoicing.</p>

<p>On March 22nd, 2013, the replacement dasKeyboard dies. No keys work at all. Tested
on two machines.  All the indicator lights stay on steady while
it&#8217;s plugged in.  No keys work at all.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve put in a support ticket to dasKeyboard, as I&#8217;m sure this could be just
a coincidence.</p>

<p>As of writing this, I haven&#8217;t heard back from them either on twitter or via email
support.  I&#8217;ll likely just return the keyboard to Amazon for a refund.</p>

<p>In other news, turns out there is a <a href="http://www.microcenter.com">Micro Center</a> in
the Denver Tech Center.  I just went and picked up a CM Storm QuickFire keyboard with
Cherry MX Blues. Here&#8217;s to hoping I have better luck with this keyboard.</p>

  <p>I start new projects all the time.  Generally, they are for no reason other than the fun of it.</p>

<p>I also try to hold myself to open sourcing them if I&#8217;m not planning on using them in the future.  They are great code samples, and interest can always bring you back to that project.</p>

<p>One of these projects, Dysnomia, is a 3d Voxel (Volumetric Pixel) editor, that I made.  It&#8217;s not very polished, but it does a decent job of what it&#8217;s supposed to do.  It&#8217;s built in Java, with LWJGL (OpenGL), and implements concepts such as 3d Picking (Color Picking) and &#8220;planes&#8221; (i.e. A GUI / HUD plane vs 3d Space).</p>

<p>If you are interested, it&#8217;s now available over at my <a href="http://github.com/sgricci/dysnomia">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>If you have any questions or need some help getting it running, let me know on twitter: <a href="http://twitter.com/sgricci">@sgricci</a></p>

  <p>I&#8217;m a command line junkie.  I spend most of the day in command-line based tools (vim, git, mysql, etc.).  I rarely ever use anything with a gui besides a browser.</p>

<p>I love using <a href="http://sprint.ly">sprint.ly</a>, it&#8217;s an awesome tool for agile development. Sadly it doesn&#8217;t have a command line tool, and no one has created one yet.  When I&#8217;m hacking away on a personal project and I want to keep a rolling todo list, I use todo.pl (which uses the <a href="http://www.hiveminder.com">hiveminder</a> API for a backend.)  Sadly, the default todo.pl script (which can be installed via CPAN btw) is pretty terse.  I add a task, and I want to immediately perform some additional task to it, such as adding tags, etc. So I&#8217;ve patched my todo.pl to display the task ID after adding it, here&#8217;s what I changed.</p>

<p>Open todo.pl (you can find it using <code>whereis todo.pl</code>) and locate the response_ok line for the sub <code>add_task</code> (line 357 on mine), change that line to this:</p>

<pre><code>     result_ok($result, "Created task: #".$result-&gt;{_content}-&gt;{record_locator});
</code></pre>

<p><em>Note: You&#8217;ll need root to edit this file if it&#8217;s installed globally</em></p>

<p>Now, it&#8217;ll respond with <code>Created Task: #XXXX</code>, much more useful for me.</p>

<p>&#8211;s</p>

  <p>I&#8217;ve been reading more than ever recently. I decided I&#8217;d share a few of my
favorite books from recent reading over the holidays. Mostly sci-fi and
dystopia ahead, be warned.</p>

<h2>Ready Player One</h2>

<p>This book is one of the rare ones.  It really struck a chord with me, and I
couldn&#8217;t put it down.  I consumed it over the course of a work day.</p>

<p>The book revolves around an immersive MMORPG called Oasis.  The eccentric creator
of this gaming world hides a series of puzzles in the game,
which is revealed after he has died. The story follows the hunt for this
set of puzzles and an all out war to be the first to reach the last puzzle.</p>

<p>As with most good books, there is also a love interest, and DeLoreans that achieve
light speed.</p>

<p><em>Rating: 5/5</em></p>

<h2>Ender&#8217;s Game</h2>

<p>This book.. was amazing.  It&#8217;s actually part of a quintet, but I feel the first
book ends in such a way, it is optional whether you read the other 3. (I haven&#8217;t)</p>

<p>This book is futuristic, with population-density issues, and a
&#8220;big brother&#8221;/overwatcher feel to it.  The ending is amazing, and it&#8217;s another book
that I really couldn&#8217;t put down and recommended to a few friends immediately after
finishing the last page.</p>

<p>This book revolves around Ender, who at the beginning of the book is a young gifted
boy, a third child.  Third being a rather big deal, as special permission from the
government is required, due to population control laws. Ender and his two siblings
are geniuses. There is also a seemingly never-ending war against what is reffered
to as the &#8220;bugs&#8221;, an alien race that desires to exterminate the human race. This book
takes place a decade of so after the second war with the bugs.</p>

<p><em>Rating: 5/5</em></p>

<h2>Wool #1-5</h2>

<p>Wool has been talked about quite a bit. It&#8217;s a self-published phenomenon.</p>

<p>The series is actually 5 short stories.  They all tend to revolve around different
aspects of a place called &#8220;The Silo&#8221;.  The Silo is an underground living quarters
that has been the home of the current inhabitants, or their ancestors for as long
as anyone can remember.</p>

<p>At the time I read the book, the first story (an easy 50 or so pages) was free on
amazon. Remember, the first hit is always free.</p>

<p>A few of the stories seem to draw it out quite a bit. In the second book, the
mayor and deputy go from the top of the silo, down around 130 flights to award
someone the honor and office of being the silo sheriff.  That book specifically
seemed to be overly descriptive. Oh, they go back up as well.</p>

<p>Overall, I liked the story in full, even if it seemed a bit scatter-brained
at times.</p>

<p>There are 2 other books (6,7), but they are prequels to the Wool saga, and the
fifth book leaves it at a good place.  I&#8217;m not specifically interested in how it
all began, as it&#8217;s generically described in the books.</p>

<ul>
<li>Rating: 3/5*</li>
</ul>

  <p>Having a bit of a problem getting yourself to step away from the desk?</p>

<p>When I first started working from home full-time, I had this problem as well.  I was overly communicative via email, IM, etc.  It turns out most people will notice this, but people don&#8217;t notice if you reply in a normal amount of time. It&#8217;s <strong>expected</strong> behavior.</p>

<p>For lunch, I realized it takes me a whole 8 minutes to make a sandwich, glass of water and consume it.  Your results are probably similar.  I started using a timer to specify how long I was going to stay away from my computer. When it was lunch time, I&#8217;d set my timer for an hour. During this time, I would not touch my computer, or check e-mail on my phone.  It was tough for the first few weeks, training my brain this way.</p>

<p>After I got over the hump, it was magical.  I usually don&#8217;t use the timer any more, but I still stay away from my desk for at least an hour during the day. I eat lunch, I read on my kindle, I hang outside with my dogs and catch up on twitter, facebook, etc.</p>

<p>By the way, the non-Kindle Fire Kindles don&#8217;t have e-mail. That&#8217;s a feature. Disconnect <strong>more</strong>, it&#8217;s good for you.</p>
