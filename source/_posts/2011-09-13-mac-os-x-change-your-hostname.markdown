Here are two ways to change your hostname in Mac OS X.

The first, open a new terminal and type this:

        sudo hostname <new hostname>

*Note: You will be asked for your password, because you are performing
this command as root*

The second, go to System Preferences -> Sharing -> Computer Name.

The first option will be more immediate.
