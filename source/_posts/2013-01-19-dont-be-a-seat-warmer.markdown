I've been a ***telecommuting*** (i.e.: working from home) software developer since 2011.

It's hard to get out of the mind-set of an office environment where you are a seat warmer for ~8 hours per day.

Software Developers aren't hourly employees.  You may be paid like an hourly employee (more likely salary). But, more than likely, you are asked to go above and beyond a typical 40 hours per week, whether it's doing a deploy or help with a DevOps operation at midnight.

It's important to realize that when working from home, it's not the hours you put in that your employer receives, it's your **work**.
