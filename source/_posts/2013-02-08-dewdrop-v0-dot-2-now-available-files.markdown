Dewdrop (v0.2), the [Droplr](https://droplr.com/join/uOXTW96Q) client for Linux, 
is now available for download. It can be downloaded here: [d.pr/f/qlTo](http://d.pr/f/qlTo)

New in this release: Files! You can now upload files by right clicking on the 
system tray icon, and then clicking 'Upload File...'.

We now also check to see if a new update is available, and notify you when it is.

There have also been a few bug fixes, changes are as follows:

* New Menu Item: Upload file (Opens file chooser dialog and uploads to droplr)
* Added window icon (for task bar)
* Bug: Application would stay running if you closed the login window using the 
window close button
* Bug: Selection window would generate warning if selection height or width = 0
* Update notification when new version is available
