Slowly becoming my favorite, my Useful Unix Command of the moment is: [fc](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fc_%28Unix%29)

fc allows you to open the last run command in an editor.  By default, it will open with the editor set up in $EDITOR (vim for me).

If you have ever had to type a really long command out, and missed something, or wanted to run it for several more files, fc is very useful as it opens in Vim ($EDITOR) and then, upon closing, will run the command again.

This command works on most Linux systems, Unix systems and on Mac OS X.  Give it a try.
