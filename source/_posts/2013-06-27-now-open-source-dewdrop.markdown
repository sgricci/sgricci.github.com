I recently open sourced the Linux [Droplr (referral link)](https://droplr.com/join/VWrQ8aUQ).

It's Python and GTK. I've licensed it under GPLv2.

Since the Droplr API is restricted, you'll have to get your own API keys from the guys 
over at Droplr. You can find more information 
[here](http://help.droplr.com/customer/portal/articles/1014091-introduction). 
Droplr has assured me that they would try hook up anyone requesting API credentials ASAP.
