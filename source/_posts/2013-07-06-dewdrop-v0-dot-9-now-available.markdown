Dewdrop (v0.9), the [Droplr](https://droplr.com/join/uOXTW96Q) client for Linux, 
is now available for download. It can be downloaded here: 
[d.pr/f/k2fG](http://d.pr/f/k2fG)

This release brings us very close to my vision of a feature complete version 1.0 
release.

In this version, a new Note Window has been added (much like the official Droplr 
(Mac) client), which will allow you to paste in text to upload to droplr, with 
selections for type (Markdown, etc).

Also in this version, a new drop target. This allows you to upload files via 
drag and drop.

The vast majority of these changes are only here because Dewdrop is also 
now open source:

Thanks to [adamgalloway-nrg](https://github.com/adamgalloway-nrg) for putting in 
some great new features and making this release possible.

And please report any bugs and/or feature requests on
[the official github repo](https://github.com/sgricci/dewdrop/issues).
