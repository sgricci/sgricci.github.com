Having a bit of a problem getting yourself to step away from the desk?

When I first started working from home full-time, I had this problem as well.  I was overly communicative via email, IM, etc.  It turns out most people will notice this, but people don't notice if you reply in a normal amount of time. It's **expected** behavior.

For lunch, I realized it takes me a whole 8 minutes to make a sandwich, glass of water and consume it.  Your results are probably similar.  I started using a timer to specify how long I was going to stay away from my computer. When it was lunch time, I'd set my timer for an hour. During this time, I would not touch my computer, or check e-mail on my phone.  It was tough for the first few weeks, training my brain this way.

After I got over the hump, it was magical.  I usually don't use the timer any more, but I still stay away from my desk for at least an hour during the day. I eat lunch, I read on my kindle, I hang outside with my dogs and catch up on twitter, facebook, etc.

By the way, the non-Kindle Fire Kindles don't have e-mail. That's a feature. Disconnect **more**, it's good for you.
